## What's this then?
This is my side hustle attempt to become a crypto billionaire / foray into the world of quant trading. 

## Central thesis
Traditional markets are traded by very smart people with very powerful computers, and finding an edge therein is next to impossible for a plonker on a macbook (e.g. me). However, there are still a lot of amateurs in the crypto markets, and most city traders aren't allowed to trade crypto (at work anyway), so there may be some value in trading on strategies which were eaten a long time ago in other markets. My main concern is that the crypto markets are even less rational than traditional markets on account of the level of non-professional involvement, and as asset price is somewhat detached from underlying value, it is a fool's errand to trade them at all. We shall see.

Also, Ray Dalio thinks https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/ray-dalio-what-i-think-of-bitcoin that bitcoin is a gold-like asset, so I'm going to focus on commodity-ish strategies.

"You could publish my trading rules in the newspaper and no-one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are 80% as good as what we taught our people. What they couldn't do is give them the confidence to sitck to those rules even when things are going bad" - Richard Dennis

## Plan:
1. Backtest turtle trading strategy
  - I read this book ages ago and always wanted to see what would happen if one followed it now
  - It is straightforward, easy to backtest, and as good a place to start as any.

2. Add a bunch of technical indicators to historical dataset, then run it through some ml algorithms and see what happens
  - Yes I know this is what all the goons are up to
  - No, I don't care because I think it will be fun
  - I'm gonna learn ARIMA forecasting

3. Additional datasets
  - What else can I throw in there?

4. NLP Sentiment analysis
  - twitter
  - r/wallstreetbets

5. Build kraken / binance bot
  - This won't be deployed until I have a (potentially) successful strategy, but I want to learn how this stuff works
